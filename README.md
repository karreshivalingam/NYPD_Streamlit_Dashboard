This project focuses on analyzing crime complaints reported across New York City in the year 2025. The data has been collected and published by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and is available through the NYC Open Data Portal.

By examining this data, we can uncover patterns about when and where crimes happen, what types of crimes are most common, and whether age or location affects the frequency of crime. These insights can be useful for public awareness, city planning, and safety improvements.
