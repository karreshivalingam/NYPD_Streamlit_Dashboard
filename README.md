# 🗽 NYPD Crime Complaint Analysis – 2025

This project focuses on analyzing crime complaints reported across New York City in the year 2025. The data has been collected and published by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and is available through the NYC Open Data Portal.

## 📊 Objective

By examining this data, we can uncover patterns about when and where crimes happen, what types of crimes are most common, and whether age or location affects the frequency of crime. These insights can be useful for public awareness, city planning, and safety improvements.


##  Analytical Questions Explored in This Project

This project uses the NYPD Complaint Data to explore and answer key analytical questions about crime in New York City through interactive visualizations. Each question is addressed using a separate plot.

###  Questions and Corresponding Visualizations

1. **Which borough in NYC receives the highest number of crime complaints?**  
   → *Answered using a bar plot of complaint count by borough (Plot 1).*

2. **What are the top 10 most frequently reported complaint types in NYC?**  
   → *Answered using a bar plot of top 10 complaint types (Plot 2).*

3. **How do crime complaints vary by month throughout the year?**  
   → *Answered using a time series/bar plot of monthly complaint counts (Plot 3).*

4. **What are the most common locations where crimes are reported?**  
   → *Answered using a bar plot of complaints by location type (Plot 4).*

5. **How do different boroughs compare in terms of specific complaint types?**  
   → *Answered using a grouped bar chart or heatmap of complaint types per borough (Plot 5).*

6. **Where are the geographical hotspots of crime in New York City?**  
   → *Answered using an interactive density map of complaint locations (Plot 6).*

7. **How have the top 4 offense types trended weekly over the past 6 months?**  
   → *Answered using a line plot showing weekly complaint trends (Plot 7).*

8. **Which age groups are most frequently involved in reported complaints?**  
   → *Answered using a bar chart of complaints by victim/perpetrator age group (Plot 8).*

9. **On which days of the week are crimes most commonly reported?**  
   → *Answered using a bar plot of complaints by day of the week (Plot 9).*

10. **What are the most reported offense types in each borough?**  
    → *Answered using a heatmap showing top complaint types by borough (Plot 10).*

11. **At what time of day are most complaints reported?**  
    → *Answered using a histogram or interactive bar chart of complaint hours (Plot 11).*

Each visualization helps uncover patterns that can assist the NYPD and policymakers in making data-driven decisions to improve public safety in New York City.
